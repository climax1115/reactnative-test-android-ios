# reactnative-test-android-ios
I built this using React Native based on Figma Design.
I coded in Visual Studio Code and tested at Android Studio Emulator.
Through building this app to debug-version apk, I finally built it to release-version apk.
Then, I passed the apk through lots of mobile devices at Browserstack to check out the full responsibility of this app.
